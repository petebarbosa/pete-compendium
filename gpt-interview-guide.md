# ChatGPT interview guide

This is a small guide to help you use ChatGPT to prepare yourself into interviews and fine tuning your resume.

**REMEMBER**: This is not supposed to be a copy and paste of everything GPT gives yous. It's supposed to help you make the process of faster. Don't be a lazy ass, the recruiter will know.

------

```markdown
Act as a career consultant in the tech industry. Describe the 5 most important responsibilities for the `job position` at `company name`.

## Job description

`Add job description here`
```

With de information provided ask:

```markdown
Act as a career consultant and based on the job description, what are the top 3 challenges a professional would face in their daily work in this role?
```

Now keep going with:

```markdown
Acting as a career consultant, what are the top 5 skills a candidate should possess to stand out during the selection process for this opportunity?
```

Now we're going to make some small changes to our resume using what GPT has given us:

```markdown
Please review my resume based on the 5 key responsibilities you've identified for the `job position` position at Soutag, the 3 biggest challenges, and the 5 skills needed to stand out. Here is the information from my resume:

## Resume

`Add resume here`
```

With this we'll use it to help us create a good cover letter. Remember that this is just a starting point. Read it and make changes, make it personal. It's just supposed to be a helping hand, not do it for you.

```markdown
Now, act as a me applying for the `job position` position at `company name`. Write a cover letter for this role, focusing on the main challenges identified. Include points about your previous work experience to demonstrate that you have what it takes to tackle these challenges and that you have solid expertise in this field. Do not make up any information. Keep the letter under 300 words, with a casual yet professional tone. The first paragraph should grab the recruiters' attention. Here are your most recent experiences:

## Recent experiences

`Add recent experiences here. Try to add as much as you remember.`
```

Let's wrap it up with an e-mail for you to reach out to the recruiter:

```markdown
Based on the cover letter and resume you've already reviewed, write an email introducing yourself to the recruiter for the `job position` position at `company name`. Keep the tone casual, with a maximum of 150 words. Explain why you're the ideal candidate for the role, and mention that youâ€™ve attached your resume to the email.
```

Hope this helped. Use it to help you create your application, do not just copy and paste. Good luck!
