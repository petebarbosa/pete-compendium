## Talk about yourself

Follow the guidelines below to craft a convincing and concise response to this question, which many find quite difficult.

### 1. Job description

Take the job description and highlight or note down all the elements, tasks, and skills required for the position that you have experience in.

Try to highlight at least three things you've experienced, either in previous jobs, courses, or certifications. This way, we can establish a chronological order of our learning, which we'll use to structure our narrative.

I've made a ChatGPT guide that can help out with this topic, [here it goes]()

### 2. Where did I come from?

The focus here is to explain how you ended up in the profession you're in today, the type of work you do, or why you studied what you did. In this part, you can already include some of the highlighted elements from the job description.

> Where did I come from?

> How did I end up in this profession?

### 3. What have I done so far?

This is the most important part because it's where you'll present the bulk of the information relevant to the position, so focus on the highlighted items.

> What tasks have I performed in this field?

> What challenges have I faced?

> What kinds of things have you done to get to where you are today?

### 4. Where am I currently?

> What is my current work situation?

> Why am I applying for this job?

> Why are you leaving the company you are currently at?

### Example

> Thank you for speaking with me! I’m excited to learn that `company_name` is hiring.
>
> Well, I have been a `field_of_work` for `X` years. I’m from `LOCATION`. Since I have long-standing experience with `activity_1`, I have worked with `activity_2` since `DATE`.
>
> After studying `subject`, I had the opportunity to join the `team_name` team at `company_name`. There, I worked with `activity_3`, coordinated `activity_4`, based on `knowledge_for_the_position`.
>
> Currently, I am a `job_title` at `company_name`, where I work with `activity_1`, `activity_2`, among other things...
>
> That brings me to today. I have been seeking a new opportunity to work in an industry like yours, and that's when I found this position.

<a id="questions-to-ask"></a>
## Questions to ask

### 1. Ask about a moment when an employee impressed the manager:

> Can you tell me about a moment when one of your subordinates or team members impressed you?

### 2. Ask about turnover:

> Who is the person that has been on the team the longest?

> What is the average time developers stay on the team?

### 3. Ask if the position is new or replacing someone:

> Is this a new position, or is it replacing someone?

The idea here is that there is a completely different dynamic if the position is new or if someone left the company or was promoted.

### 4. Ask what is expected of you:

> What kind of colleague are you looking for?

This question is better directed to the manager or your potential supervisor for the position.

With their response, you can charm them by saying: "Wow, I really identify with that too!"

### 5. Ask about the problem:

> What is the biggest challenge or problem that this position needs to solve?

With this question, we find out the extent of the challenge we’ll be facing.

### 6. Ask about the interviewer’s feelings towards the company:

> What do you like most about working at this company?

This is a good question to see if what the interviewer highlights is also what you're looking for in a job. It’s also a chance to evaluate if the company’s image on LinkedIn or in the job ad holds true.

## Hints

- Identify yourself with some points from the position. It's not just "Oh, this is a developer position, I like writing code". Give it a thought, prepare to present it, like:

> Description: This is position is for a startup so we're always running against the clock.
>
> "I noticed that you're looking for someone that is adaptable and that knows how to work under pressure, because it's a fast growing startup. I'm well versed in this type of environment. I can work really with a tight schedule."
